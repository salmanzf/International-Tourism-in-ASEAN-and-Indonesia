2019 is a good year for international tourism in ASEAN, all of the countries has increases in total visitor from international tourist either slightly or significant.

| Country:| Brunei Darussalam | Cambodia | Indonesia | Lao PDR | Malaysia | Myanmar | Philipines | Singapore | Thailand | Viet Nam |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visitor Growth in 2019:| 19,81% | 6,6% | 1,88% | 14,44% | 1,04% | 22,95% | 15,90% | 3,27% | 4,55% | 16,20% |

### International Arrival in Indonesia
Indonesia has a total of 16,1 Millions total international tourist visitor in 2019, which is an increase of 1,88% compared to previous year. Despite the increase, it has one of the lowest growth of total international tourist visitor in ASEAN (2nd lowest). In 2019 Indonesia is the 5th most desirable destination country among ASEAN countries, overtaken by Viet Nam at 4th spot.

If we compare it to the average of total arrival per world countries (assuming there are 195 countries), most of the time international tourism in Indonesia perform below average. This happens because of the late growth in international tourism sector during 1990s and early 2000 up until 2006 where we can see the constant growth. The growth began when the marketing started by The Indonesian Ministry of Culture and Tourism in 2008 as "Visit Indonesia Year" until 2011. Since 2011 until now, the marketing use "Wonderful Indonesia" as a new campaign.
 
## Revenue of International Tourism
This is the most important aspect for destination country to determine whether international tourism sector is succesful or not besides the total visit.

In 2018, Thailand become the most successful country in ASEAN in terms of total revenue since its high correlation with total visit. It also has the most spending per visit followed by Philipines and Indonesia which imply these 3 countries has potential to expand more tourism spot, especially Philippines and Indonesia since these two has lower total revenue and total visit yet has more revenue per visit than Singapore and Malaysia.
 
# Outbound International Tourism Activity
## International Departure in ASEAN
Not only we want to see the trend of international tourist activity into our country, but we want to see how our citizens activity as tourist in another country.
![Departure ASEAN](https://github.com/salmanzf/International-Tourism-in-ASEAN-and-Indonesia/blob/streamlit/plot%20picture/departure%20asean.png)
Thailand as the number 1 international tourist destination spot in ASEAN has low interest on its citizen to travel to another country. Surprisingly, Indonesia has the lowest departure rate among the exisiting data in ASEAN countries.
 
We can see huge discrepancy between Singapore and other ASEAN countries in terms of departure rate. The main difference between Singapore and other ASEAN countries is only Singapore categorized as "World Bank High Income" and by a really huge margin compared to others.
![depart world bank](https://github.com/salmanzf/International-Tourism-in-ASEAN-and-Indonesia/blob/streamlit/plot%20picture/depart%20world%20bank%20income.png)
We can see the correlation between GNI of countries with interest of outbound tourist interest, **the higher GNI of country then the higher interest of its citizen to travel as a tourist to another country**.
